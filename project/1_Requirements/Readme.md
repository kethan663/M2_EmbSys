# Description

This project  is to create a  regulated irrigation system that will provide autonomous irrigation for plants while saving water and money. 
The major goal is to use the system to improve the soil's and hence the plant's health by using several sensors.For optimal plant growth, 
a sufficient amount of water in the soil is required. Also, because water is such an important component of life, it is necessary to limit
its use. Irrigation is the largest user of water. This necessitates the need to manage irrigation water delivery.

# Identifying Features
* It should provide the water to the plants whenever it senses the dry soil.
* It should stop the water of the motor when there is wet soil.
# State of Art
* The key focus here is on having a motor that is intelligent enough.
* The motor should ON and OFF itself automatically.
* As the world progresses, technology must evolve to keep up.
